# Tickets Repository

## Overview

The `tickets` repository is dedicated to managing and tracking user-reported
issues, bugs, and feedback related to the Mhai project. It serves as a platform
where users and contributors can open tickets to report problems, suggest new
features, or provide general feedback to help improve the project.

## How to Use

1. **Create a Ticket**: Click on the "Issues" tab and select "New Issue" to open
   a ticket.

   - Provide a clear and concise title.
   - Include a detailed description of the issue or suggestion.
   - Attach any relevant screenshots, logs, or files, if applicable.

2. **Follow Up**: Track the progress of your ticket through the comments and
   status updates. You may also be asked for additional information or
   clarification.

We welcome feedback from all users. If you encounter an issue
or have a suggestion, please do not hesitate to open a ticket. 
If you want to share something privately, please send us an email.
